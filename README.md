This is the github page for the final project of the Practical Machine Learning course.

Both a Rmd file and an html can be viewed from this page. In the files I explain how I cleaned the data, why I chose the model I did and how I built it. Although the algorithm I chose did not require cross validation, I estimated the out-of-sample error by partitioning the data and prediction on a validation set, then I still made the prediction for the original testing data set provided by the instructors.
